## I want to report a bug

We use `GitHub issues` for tracking bugs, new features and the overall progress. Fill out the issue report in the [iOS app](https://github.com/ProteGO-app/ios/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=), [Android app](https://github.com/ProteGO-app/android/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=) or [the server](https://github.com/ProteGO-app/backend/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Remember to provide every piece of information needed to reproduce the bug and - before opening the report - to check existing issues already open on GitHub.

## I want to report a security bug

Before you report a security issue, check our [list of known security issues](specs/security.md). If you want to report a critical bug, contact us directly. Otherwise, use [`GitHub issues`](#I-want-to-report-a-bug)

## I'm a programmer, how can I help?

There is a number of ways in which you can make an immediate impact:
* Audit the existing code
* Browse through the current ticket list to see what we're working on
* Open your own `Pull Request`.
* Review existing `Pull Requests`.
Communicate with us via GitHub.

TBD: add information about formal requirements for collaborators.

## I want to help testing the app

You can find instructions on how to join the testing team [here](specs/testing.md).

## I have an idea for a new functionality

New features are planned using [GitHub issues](https://github.com/ProteGO-app/specs/issues). Before opening a ticket, browse through the list of existing ones to avoid duplicates.

## How else can I help?

Use the app, tell your friends about it, get your family on board. Follow the project on social media
