# Short English overview of the application

The purpose of the application is to assist in transition from a nationwide to only a selective quarantine of people who may have been exposed to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The application is built by the community of citizens in cooperation with the Ministry of Digital Affairs, publisher of the application.

The application balances the need to preserve the privacy of citizens with the need to collect information about who could be infected.

The application requires a phone number and its confirmation by SMS. The phone number is required so that Polish health authorities can contact the user who has been nearby people testing positive.

After installing, the app securely searches for other devices via Bluetooth. It saves a two weeks history of all the devices encountered. This data is stored encrypted only on citizens' devices and is not sent to any central server.

Data is sent to the server only when the user of the application has been tested positive for coronavirus. In this case, the health authority instructs the patient how to send data from the phone to the server.

The data is sent to the server where the health authority personel, based on their analysis (length, frequency, proximity in accordance with WHO standards), decides which people should be subject to home quarantine.

After opening the application, each user can check their personalized status:

* Green – you can go out freely and follow the applicable regulations
* Orange – two weeks have not passed since the application was installed, we do not have enough data to determine the status. Be careful.
* Red – contact health authorities and isolate yourself in a home quarantine

Ultimately, the application should be installed by every citizen. We then start building a culture of using the application, e.g. by showing each other your green status.

Due to understandable social resistance to permanent surveillance of citizens, we place great emphasis on ensuring privacy. The application code is made public (open source) and can be audited by experts.
